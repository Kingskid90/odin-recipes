Hello everyone!
My name is George Hassan Issifu but you can call me George kingskid.
I'm learning web development on the Odin's Project.
Currently, I've basic skills in HTML and CSS.
I'll be using these skills to  build a basic recipe website. My website will have a primary index page which will have links to a few recipes.
By the end of this project, I hope to improve my HTML skills and my confidence in web development.
