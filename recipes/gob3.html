    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Gari and Beans meal, popularly known as 'gob3' is my personal favorite meal. From the name of the meal, it can be derived that the meal is made of 'gari' - roasted cassava flakes and beans. This meal can be garnished with palm oil and fried ripe plantain. This meal is very popular among Ghanaian students because it is affordable, delicious and keeps you full for a long time. </p>
